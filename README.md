CS Theory course
================

Lesson 01 - Numeral systems
---------------------------
* oct_to_dec - convert octal numbers to decimal
* hex_to_sept - convert hexadecimal numbers to septenary. Here I'm use functions to_dec() and from_dec() that usable for any numeral systems.

Lesson 02 - Representation of data
----------------------------------
Here we have program with class Numbers that realizes summation, subtraction and multiplication for numbers with any numeral systems from 2 to 256.
Each digit of number which we work presented as separated element of list, so it's kinda of realization of arbitrary-precision arithmetic. 

Lesson 04 - O-notation
----------------------------------
We consider O-notation, and calculate processing time of following algorithms: insertion sort, selection sort and combining of two arrays.
